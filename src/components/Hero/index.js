            "I think the fashion is super serious and humor is suspect and
            people don't always know how to approach it. Sometimes people have
            questioned whether I was making fun of the industry or just at
            myself. I'm just trying to raise a smile. Clothes aren't meant to be
            worshipped at a church altar. I have a different approach to most
            designers." â€”<strong>Jeremy Scott</strong>
